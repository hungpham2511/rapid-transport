This repo contains programs I wrote while writing my paper on using
TOPP-RA for object transportation.

These programs are used for simmplifying the contact profiles, viewing
test trajectories, computing simple objects' inertial properties,
parametrizing trajectories subject to constraints.

Data files are not released.
