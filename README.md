Critically fast pick-and-place with suction cups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repo contains programs for planning *critically fast* motion for
robotic manipulators performing pick-and-place with a suction cup.

I wrote while writing my paper on
using TOPP-RA for object transportation.

These programs are used for simmplifying the contact profiles, viewing
test trajectories, computing simple objects' inertial properties,
parametrizing trajectories subject to constraints.

Data files are not released.
